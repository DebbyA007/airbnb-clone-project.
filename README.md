## Why User-Friendly Design Is Important in a Booking System üßë‚Äçüíª

A user-friendly design ensures that people can use your website without confusion or frustration. In a booking system, this is crucial because users need to quickly find a property, check the price, and book it smoothly.

If the website is hard to use, users may abandon it and choose a competitor. A clear, simple, and visually appealing design builds trust, encourages users to complete their bookings, and fosters return visits. A user-friendly design also minimizes errors, such as booking the wrong dates or properties.

**In short, user-friendly design helps to:**
- Allow users to find what they need quickly.
- Make the booking process seamless.
- Build user trust.
- Encourage repeat bookings and recommendations.

## Importance of Identifying Design Properties in a Mockup

Mockups serve as a visual blueprint of what a website or app will look like before it is developed. Understanding the design properties‚Äîsuch as colors, font sizes, spacing, and layout‚Äîensures that the development process aligns with the intended design.

**Benefits of identifying design properties:**
- Ensures the website matches the design perfectly.
- Maintains consistency and professionalism.
- Saves time by eliminating guesswork.
- Improves collaboration by providing a clear plan for the team.
